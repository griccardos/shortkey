# Shortkey

Limit the use of the mouse, but using keyboard shortcuts to access points of interest on the screen. This application allows you to click button like elements on the screen using a shortcut without having to use the mouse for that one click.

Similar to using alt to access the menu bar, this application allows you to access other elements on the screen using a shortcut.

Useful for people with conditions that prevent full use of the mouse.

## Who is this for?
- those with accessibility issues that cannot use a mouse
- those who want to limit the use of the mouse
- those that want to make the most of their new ergonomic keyboard
- that one time where you don't want to reach for the mouse and think there must be another way. This. This is that way.

## Getting Started
Navigate to the window you want shortcuts on  
Default shortcut to open the app is `alt+enter`  
Select elements with `arrow keys` or `space+j/k`  
Press `enter` to click the selected element  
Press `ctrl+enter` to right click the selected element  

## Notes
- Browsers typically have thousands of elements, so they take longer. It is recommended to rather use a similar tool made for them e.g. Vimium
- Not all elements are made visible.
